## Overview of the Loan Prediction Risk Analysis

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good 
loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, you’ll need to employ 
different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. 
 you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and 
 evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending 
services company, you’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and 
SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids 
algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over- and 
undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new 
machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier 
and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once you’re done, you’ll 
evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation 
on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
